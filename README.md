### Undergraduate School Projects
#### Inferior Goods and Luxury Goods: Theory or Practice?

  ● Coded data cleaner in Python to align different sources of consumer data into the same format  
  ● Concluded that low-income consumers considered savings an inferior good (slope of -6.11) and
    credit card debt a luxury good (slope of +1.02); the opposite being (+3.83, -.246 respectively)  
  ● Created tables in SQL and line charts in PowerBI to model the percent change growth of
    consumption versus the growth of budgets in the form of household income

#### EV Charging Station Growth and Outliers in the United States
  ● Used Vlookup and Excel filters to clean tens of thousands of cells of electric vehicle station data  
  ● Visualized data in Microsoft Azure to show that states’ EV charging station numbers are
    increasing related to population density; outliers include: OK, AL, UT (showing rapid growth and
    low population density); research into why these outliers exist are likely to prove profitable

#### Increase Net Savings!
  ● Utilized Excel to record personal spending habits and identify 7 reducible cost categories  
  ● Forecasted total personal spending given decreases in specific spending categories to allocate
    more to savings; led to a spending decrease of 22% on average over two years

#### Driver Profit Maximizer
  ● Programmed Python app automate order selection based on profit analysis of routes, costs, times,
    and dollars per minute, guaranteeing top 2% earnings per hour ($24.25/hr), ($22.57/hr in profit)
